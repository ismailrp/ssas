# Testing semantic models with `te test`

Companion to the te-cli skill (SKILL.md). CI wiring (pipelines, TRX publishing, promotion gates) is in config-cicd-env.md.

`te test` runs DAX assertion tests, so every executing subcommand (`run`, `snapshot`, `compare`) needs a **deployed model** (`-s`/`-d` or an active connection); a local `--model` path cannot execute DAX. The model is always given with `--model`/`-m` or `-s`/`-d`, never as a trailing positional argument. The suite files themselves live in the repo next to the model source, which is the point: a PR that changes a measure carries its test change in the same diff.

`te test spec` prints the authoritative format reference from the binary (`--json-schema` emits the JSON Schema for editor validation); `te test init --example` scaffolds a richly commented suite showing every assertion type. What follows is the working knowledge.

## Suite anatomy

A suite is a directory (default `.te-tests/`) of `*.test.yaml` files, discovered recursively. `te test init` also drops a `schema.json` so editors validate the YAML (`# yaml-language-server: $schema=schema.json`).

```yaml
suite: Revenue regression
description: Guards the core revenue measures
connection:            # optional; otherwise -s/-d at run time wins
  server: MyWorkspace
  database: Sales Model
  auth: env
defaults:
  tolerance: 0.01      # 1% relative, applied to every test unless overridden
  tags: [revenue]
tests:
  - name: FY25 revenue matches finance sign-off
    query: |
      EVALUATE ROW("Revenue", CALCULATE([Total Revenue], 'Date'[FY] = "FY25"))
    expect:
      Revenue:
        value: 12500000
        tolerance: 0.001
  - name: No orphan sales rows
    query: EVALUATE ROW("Orphans", COUNTROWS(FILTER(Sales, ISBLANK(RELATED(Product[ProductKey])))))
    tags: [integrity]
    expect:
      Orphans: 0
```

Top-level fields: `suite`, `description`, `connection` (`server`, `database`, `auth`), `defaults` (`tolerance`, `tags`), `tests`. Test-case fields: `name` (unique within the suite), `query` (inline DAX, multiline with `|`) or `query_file` (path to a `.dax` file relative to the suite dir), `tags` (filter with `te test run --tag <tag>`), `tolerance` / `tolerance_abs` overrides, `matrix` (parameterized expansion; `{var}` placeholders in the query and expectations), `expect` (at least one assertion), and `compare` (multi-row diff settings used by `te test compare`).

## Assertion types

```yaml
expect:
  Revenue: 100                      # exact (numbers use tolerance if set)
  Margin: { gt: 0 }                 # gt / gte / lt / lte
  Ratio: { gte: 0.1, lte: 0.9 }     # range
  rows: 5                           # exact row count
  rows: { gte: 1, lte: 100 }        # row-count range
  empty: false                      # >= 1 row (true = must be 0 rows)
  columns: [Region, Revenue]        # result has these columns
  error: true                       # the query itself is expected to fail
```

A `ROW("A", ..., "B", ...)` query asserts multiple columns in one test. Relative `tolerance` is a fraction (0.01 = 1%); `tolerance_abs` is a raw value; when both are set, passing either satisfies the assertion. Strings and dates always match exactly.

Assertions worth writing first, in rough order of value:

- **Reconciliation**: one measure per business-critical number, asserted against an externally agreed value with a tight tolerance
- **Invariants**: `empty: true` on "rows that should never exist" queries (orphan keys, negative quantities, duplicate dimension keys, date-table gaps)
- **Shape guards**: `rows:`/`columns:` on queries a report page depends on
- **Not-blank smoke**: `empty: false` on each fact table and headline measure; the cheapest possible post-deploy signal

## Generating and running

```bash
te test init --example                      # commented reference suite (into .te-tests/; --path <dir> elsewhere)
te test init --from-model --model ./model   # one stub per model measure; keep the ones worth asserting
te test list --suite .te-tests              # parse check without a connection (--tag narrows)
te test run -s ws -d model --auth env --non-interactive --ci github --trx test.trx
te test run --tag integrity                 # subset by tag
te test run --suite ./suites/revenue --output-format json   # machine-readable, one document
te test use ./suites/revenue                # session-scoped active suite (interactive work); bare `te test use` clears it
```

`te test run` flags: `--suite <dir>`, `--tag <tag>`, `--fail-on error|warning` (default `error`), `--ci vsts|github`, `--trx <path>`. It exits `1` when any test fails at or above the threshold, which is what makes it a pipeline gate. Suites are validated before any connection is made: a suite that fails validation (a missing `query_file`, a test with no `expect`) also exits `1` without running anything, so a broken YAML file cannot pass as "no tests ran".

### JSON output

Under `--output-format json`, `te test run` emits the findings envelope shared with `te validate`, `te bpa run` and `te query` - a single document, always:

```json
{
  "command": "test run",
  "durationMs": 1830,
  "summary": { "errors": 1, "warnings": 0, "info": 0, "total": 1 },
  "findings": [
    { "severity": "error", "source": "test", "code": "TEST_FAIL", "message": "...",
      "object": "FY25 revenue matches finance sign-off", "objectType": "Test", "fixable": false }
  ],
  "suites": [ ... ],
  "invalidSuites": [ { "file": "...", "validationErrors": [ "..." ] } ],
  "testSummary": { "passed": 11, "failed": 1, "errored": 0, "skipped": 0, "invalidSuites": 0, "total": 12, "durationMs": 1830 }
}
```

- `findings[]` carries one entry per problem: `TEST_FAIL` (assertion failed), `TEST_ERROR` (the query errored when it was not expected to), `TEST_SUITE_INVALID` (a suite file failed validation; `objectType` is `TestSuite`). Passing tests do not appear in `findings`.
- `summary` is the severity tally shared with the other commands; **`testSummary`** holds the per-status test tallies (`passed`, `failed`, `errored`, `skipped`, `invalidSuites`, `total`).
- `suites[]` (per-suite results) and `invalidSuites[]` (file plus `validationErrors[]`) are retained alongside the envelope.
- Test findings carry `object`/`objectType` but no `objectPath`, since a test is not a model object.

With `--ci github`/`--ci vsts`, annotations go to stderr and carry the finding code, so stdout stays parseable.

## Snapshot regression (refactor guard)

Snapshots capture every measure's value (auto-generated `ROW()` queries, or the suite's queries with `--suite`) so a refactor can prove it changed nothing:

```bash
te test snapshot --save baseline.snapshot.json -s ws -d model
# ...refactor measures, redeploy...
te test snapshot --diff baseline.snapshot.json --tolerance 0.001 -s ws -d model
```

Scope with `--measures "Revenue*"` (glob on measure names) or `--table Sales`. `--save` here names the snapshot file to write and has nothing to do with the mutation flag on editing commands. Snapshots compare a model against its own past; data refreshes between capture and diff will show up as drift, so snapshot workflows fit refactors on a stable dataset, not moving data.

## A/B compare (pre-cutover gate)

`te test compare` runs the same suite against two deployed models and diffs the results; use it before promoting a candidate over prod:

```bash
te test compare --source-a prod-ws/prod-model --source-b test-ws/candidate-model --suite .te-tests --tolerance 0.001
```

Each side is `workspace/model`. `--auth-a`/`--auth-b` allow different credentials per side (e.g. prod read via one SPN, test via another). Without `--suite`, compare runs auto-generated measure queries, like `snapshot` does.
